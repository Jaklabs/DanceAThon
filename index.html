      <h1> What is it? </h1>
        <p>This is a fundraiser for the Puente class of 2019. We have all received sponsors, who have pledged to pay a certain amount of money for every half hour that we dance.</p>

      <div class="item">
      <h1>What is it for? </h1>
      <p> Puente goes on a lot of trips, such as the annual SoCal or NorCal trips. We also throw events every year, like our Posada dinner and Baile Noche dance. But this costs money, and we are short on funds.

      <h1>What can I do? </h1>
      	<p>Find a sophomore Puentista and make a pledge for any amount you want -- whether it be a dollar or twenty dollars. And anyone can come to our event to support us, or just join the dance for fun!</p>
